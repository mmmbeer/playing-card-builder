# Center pip controls

## Enable or hide center pips
- Toggle **Show center pip** in the **Pip placement** group to add or remove the central symbol.
- Switch the mirror option when you need symmetric layouts.

## Placement sliders
- **Top**, **Inner top**, **Center**, **Inner bottom**, and **Bottom** control vertical anchor points for pip rows.
- Drag sliders to shift rows toward the edges or toward the center for compact layouts.

## Size and spacing
- Adjust the **Pip scale** to change overall size.
- Use **Horizontal spread** to widen or tighten the spacing between mirrored pips.
- Pair pip size with the **Corner spacing** offsets so ranks and suits stay clear.

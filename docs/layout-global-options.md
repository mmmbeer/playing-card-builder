# Layout and global options

## Corner spacing and alignment
- The **Corner spacing** panel controls rank and suit offsets for every card.
- **Rank offset X/Y** and **Suit offset X/Y** move indexes in tiny steps. Positive X nudges outward; positive Y nudges toward the bottom.
- Use the padlock icons to lock a value as you tweak the matching field on the opposite corner.

## Pip layout
- Switch **Show pips** on or off for numeric cards.
- **Mirror by default** duplicates corner indexes on both halves of the card.
- **Pip spread** sets the horizontal distance for mirrored pips. Pair it with pip size for balanced spacing.
- Non-standard ranks above 10 stack extra pips on the center row before adding new rows.
- **Guidelines** highlight the safe zone, bleed, and pip anchors during edits.

## Pip placements
- Five sliders (**Top**, **Inner top**, **Center**, **Inner bottom**, **Bottom**) control row anchors.
- Adjust rows to make space for artwork or large fonts.
- Use **Horizontal spread** for subtle side-to-side shifts on mirrored pips.

## Backgrounds and global styling
- Set a solid color or image in **Background** to update every card at once.
- Tweak **Card border radius** and **Edge stroke** for a printed look that matches your theme.
- Pair background choices with font outlines and icon outlines for contrast inside the safe zone.

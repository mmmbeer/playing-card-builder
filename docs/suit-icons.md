# Suit icons and custom sheets

## Built-in sets
- Pick a set from **Built-in suit sets** for ready-made sprite sheets.
- Every set follows the standard order: top-left ♠, top-right ♥, bottom-left ♣, bottom-right ♦.

## Upload your own sheet
- Upload a 2×2 sprite sheet. Any pixel size works.
- Keep each cell square for crisp icons.
- Match the order above so suits map correctly.

## Color modes
- **Standard** leaves the sprite colors untouched.
- **Single color** tints every suit with one swatch.
- **Bi-color (red / black)** splits colors by suit color.
- **Per suit** offers four swatches.

## Icon styling
- Adjust **Icon scale** and **Opacity** to match your font weight.
- Pick an **Overlay / effect** for glow or shadow.
- Turn on **Outline / border** to add a stroke and set its width, placement, and color.

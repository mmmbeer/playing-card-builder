# Face images and bulk upload

## Single image upload
- Open the **Face image (current card)** panel and click the file area for the active suit and rank.
- Pick a PNG or JPG. The preview updates right away.
- Use **Zoom**, **Rotation**, **Flip horizontally**, and **Flip vertically** to adjust the fit.
- **Reset transform** returns scale, rotation, and flips to defaults.

Recommended source size: 825×1125 px or larger with clear edges. Larger files stay crisp when scaled down.

## Bulk upload
- Click the **⬆️ bulk** badge in the Face image panel.
- Add multiple files. The table shows a preview, rank, and suit for each file.
- File name hints speed up mapping. Examples:
  - `hearts_2.png` maps to Hearts / 2
  - `spades_k.jpg` maps to Spades / K
  - `joker_1.png` maps to the first joker
- Edit the dropdowns in the table if a file needs a different slot.
- Apply the batch to fill every listed card.

## Tips for clean results
- Keep art inside the printed **safe zone** and leave bleed for trimming.
- Leave room for pips and indexes when art has a busy background.
- Use the zoom and rotation sliders for fine framing instead of editing the source file.

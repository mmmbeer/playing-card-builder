# Decks, ranks, and jokers

## Custom rank lists
- Enter ranks with commas in **Custom ranks**. Example: `9,9,10,10,J,J,Q,Q,K,K,A,A` for a pinochle-style deck.
- Leave the field blank for A through K.
- Use letters or numbers that match your game: `0,1,2,3` or `A,B,C,D` both work.

## Joker settings
- Turn on **Include jokers / wild cards** to add extra cards to exports.
- Set **Number of jokers** and **Joker label** to match your deck.
- Choose **Joker label orientation** and **Joker label size (px)**.
- Pick a **Joker suit display** layout such as center circle, square, diamond, or rows.
- Mark jokers as wild when you want a reminder on the card face.

## Deck-wide defaults
- Adjust **Default mirror** in the **Corner spacing** panel to mirror indexes across all ranks.
- Apply **Background** settings once to style every card backplate.
- Combine rank choices with **Export filters** to create partial decks for testing.
